Particularily food that does not spoil. It's like I know that some impending doom is about to fall on the earth and this doom almost always involves water. I along with other people that I am with take food that we can survive off of as well as food that I know I will miss when it is not readily avaliable to me anymore. No one pays for the food and I always wake up as we are leaving the grocery store to try and get away from what ever force is coming.I always feel frantic but not scared.",

In one particular dream, I was with a friend of mine who is pierecer: she and I were having drinks together. I had too many and in the span of one night she tattooed me, with full arm and leg sleave, a chest and back piece. Horrible awful tattoos that had movie themes. The chest piece was the 'donnie darko' bunny. Arm was action heros.",
